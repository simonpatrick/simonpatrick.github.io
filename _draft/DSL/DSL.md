# DSL - Domain Specific Language

## What is DSL
Express a problem in the vocabulary of a particular domain and subsequently model
it in the solution domain

- problem domain
  - process
- solution domain
  - entity,process,soluton, mapping to problem domain
- Domain modeling: establishing a common vocabulary

## The Benefits Of DSL
## DSL Structure

- A DSL provides a direct mapping to the artifacts of the problem domain. If the problem domain has an entity named Trade, the DSL script must contain the same abstraction that plays the same role.
- The DSL script must use the common vocabulary of the problem domain. The vocabulary becomes the catalyst for better communication between developers and business users. When business users interact with the software domain model, the DSL script is their interface.
- The DSL script must abstract the underlying implementation. This principle is an important part of good abstraction design, and it applies to DSLs as well. The DSL script cannot contain accidental complexities that deal with implementation details.
