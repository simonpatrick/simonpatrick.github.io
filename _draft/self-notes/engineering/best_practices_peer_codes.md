# Peer Reviews
- review fewer than 200-400 lines of code
- Aim for an inspection rate of less than 300-500 LOC/hour
- Take enough time for a proper, slow review, but not more than 60-90 minutes
-  Authors should annotate source code before the review begins.
- Establish quantifiable goals for code review and capture metrics so you can improve your
processes.
- Checklists substantially improve results for both authors and reviewers.
- Verify that defects are actually fixed!
- Managers must foster a good code review culture in which finding defects is viewed
positively.
- Beware the “Big Brother” effect.
- The Ego Effect: Do at least some code review, even if you don’t have time to review it all.
- . Lightweight-style code reviews are efficient, practical, and effective at finding bugs.
