# My Owner Tester journey

My real tester career starts at a video authoring company, after around one yourï¼ŒI quite because the testing work was boring and it is nothing to do with any business logic.At that time I preferred to find a business system vendor.

  So I went to insurance system vendor which provides insurance software solution
for a specific insurance domain. I took four years there, and learned a lot.  I mainly focused on manual testing in the first three years. In those days ,not only I learned Oracle PL/SQL,insurance domain knowledge, even basic accounting knowledge, but also I learned from how the system built, what's back end data models to drive the system running. This company is not famous, but when I looked back after several years, I feel their database design is so great, it is complicated, but it is well designed not only the pattern they used but also the scalability of the design. That's why the company is selling product to almost 40 different insurance companies.
Every customer seems use the different product, but there are using same code base  with different data sets. It is amazing. If you didn't have product experience, you never know how hard it is.

In term of the complicated, the product is the most complicated one I have meet
till now. It includes insurance's policy,claim and finance system, if you want to understand all of them, you need to know:
- rating system, it many include 40-50 different kinds of factors, oh man
- accounting basic knowledge to double booking,general ledger
- claim domain knowledge for many professional terms
- the complex system configuration for different customers
- reinsurance system

After 3 years I became the expertise for every system, what I did was:
- reading rating book again and again to real understand it
- learning accounting basic knowledge
- read CPCU book
- search every professional terms if I didn't understand
- ask questions no matter they answered or not
- read codes and do the configurations by myself
- learning PL/SQL

I  can answer most of the questions to support all QAs. But the pity is that after I quit this company, the domain knowledge is useless. Only thing useful is PL/SQL. After several years, I think I took too much time for understanding the domain knowledge and the system configuration. To be honest, the good side effects is that I learned some database skills like how to understand the data model, how to learn the business logic from the data model. But it took too much, and now only some concepts are still in my head. But I am proud of what I did. I did these things without any help, but I help a lot QAs. I find my curious for learning new things no matter how hard it is,I find my ability to learn new things quickly.

The reason I left was that even you know so much about the product, even you support  the whole QA team, even you know more than developer, you are still worth a shit. It is the reality,and I am afraid It is always true for then entire QA career.

Last Year in that company, I support three projects at the same time, I worked as project manager, acting QA manager, automation team leader to build QTP automation scripts. But I am not happy at all, nobody really care about what you did, but only care about where you came from. You are a QA, you know nothing from other manager's view.

Then I left that company and joined a internet company as a contractor. I worked for a US team for one year. And unfortunately,I am the only person in China.
There is doubt that if I can do that job in different locations within a agile/scrum process. The answer is definitely yes. After the project was completed, the product manager sent an email to my manager for highly appreciated my work. This is the first time and also the last time I have ever seen that an India person using highly appreciated for a Chinese during entire my time in that company. I was proud too. What I did was:
- deliver on time
- clean report
- hold the regular meeting efficient(have you ever seem weekly meeting for agile scrum,yes I did, and did it well)
- address problem and raise questions for requirement

After that I transferred a FTE, and I wrote almost all the automation scripts for my domain. I read all the automation framework codes, and it is useful for me to create a totally different one. I was questioned for my English, for you Java coding skill. But finally it turned out that my English is not so good , but it is enough to have a good communication with US counterpart(another product manager still missing me after I left). Java is new for me,but who wrote the most complicated domain scripts, who wrote the most stable scripts. It was me. And who was the only person to take over three different projects at same time, and deliver the good quality. It was me. I was proud of what I did, even moved.

Manager was considered too many credits on what the IC achieved. Manager did nothing at all, but receive the credits because of your accomplishment. Did he/she motivate you? Did he/she care about you? Did he/she listen to you and try to understand what you really want? Did he/she show the sympathy for the difficulty you faced? Did he/she provide the training for domain knowledge or personal skill?
For me simply not.

Then I left that company to start my QA manager/arch role, I created automation framework, I have more thought on how to create a QA tools. I understand more about Agile,Product, Dev things, and also I am not be the manager I have meet, I try to be a manger which the good manager should be in mind.
A good test manager should be:
- good tech taste, able to understand the good solution or bad solution
- provide help, training and suggestion for IC
- Sit QA's seat to think
- Do real performance review
