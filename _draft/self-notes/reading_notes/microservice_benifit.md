# Microservice 好处

- Technology Heterogeneity
- Resilience: isolate issues,bulkhead
- Scaling: scaling pieces need to scale,apply on demand
- Organizational Alignment
- Composability: 可以组合
- Optimizing for Replaceablitity
- SOA

## Microservice Integration
- Avoiding Breaking changes
- Keey Your APIs Technology-Agnostic
- Make Your Service Simple for Consumers
- Hide Internal Implementation Detail
- Interfacing with Customers
- The Shared Database: Strong cohesion and loose coupling—with database integration, we lose both things.
- Synchronous Versus Asynchronous
These two different modes of communication can enable two different idiomatic styles of collaboration: request/response or event-based.
- Orchestration Versus Choreography

## Cloud Computing
- Abstract Resources
- On-Demand Provisioning
- Scalability
- No Up-Front Costs
- Efficiency of Experts

## AWS Service
Most Application Need:
- compute
- Storage
- Messaging
- Payment
- Distribution
- scale
- Analytics

## Cloud Architecture Lessons
- Design for failure and nothing fails
- Loose coupling set you free
- Implement "Elasticity"
- Build security in every layer
- Don't fear constraints
- think parallel
- leverage different storage options
